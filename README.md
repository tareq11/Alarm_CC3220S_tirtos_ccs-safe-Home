## CC3220 microcontroller:

The CC3220 is a part of the microcontroller platform and basic components in the chip, all of which share a common and easy to use development environment with a single core software development kit (SDK) and a rich toolkit.One-time integration of the SimpleLink platform allows us to add any combination of Portfolio into our design.

##  Usage

* The logical structure of our system can be divided into four main sub-systems, 
all of which connect to the MCU: 
PIR motion sensor, 
light sensor. 
At a higher level, our system interacts with the user through transmitters on the MCU and on the user's computer. The split nature of our project enables us to design, test and report bugs in each subsystem separately, both in hardware and software. The block diagram below illustrates the full structure of our system.
